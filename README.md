# Instagram Login Clone with Jetpack Compose

This repository is created as a part of my learning journey with Jetpack Compose in Android development. The project demonstrates an Instagram login screen clone, using various modern Android development practices and libraries.

## Overview

The main focus of this project is to understand and implement the following:

- **Jetpack Compose**: The modern toolkit for building native UI in Android.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Architectural pattern to separate concerns in the application.
- **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: Simplifies dependency injection in Android apps.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java to handle API requests.

## Features

- Instagram-like login screen UI.
- The app does not perform actual login functionality. It's intended for learning purposes only.
- Clean and modern Android development practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**
- **MVVM Architecture**
